# PytorchNeuralNetworks-VaccineSentimentClassifier
Making the vaccine sentiment classifier using tweets as datasets with the help of Pytorch Neural Networks and Glove word embeddings. Main activation function is PReLU with 5 layers (125-125-75-30-3(, learning rate=2e-4 and batch size=450. I also use Cross Entropy Loss in the model together with RAdam optimizer
